## Credit Card Fraud Detection

### Overview
In this project, I developed a machine learning model to detect fraudulent credit card transactions. The goal was to create a system that accurately identifies fraud while minimizing false positives, which is crucial in real-world financial applications.

### Data
The dataset consisted of anonymized credit card transactions, with features such as transaction amount, time, and more. I employed techniques like SMOTE to address the class imbalance and cleaned the data to ensure accuracy.

### Models and Techniques
- Logistic Regression
- Random Forest Classifier
- SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique)
- Cross-validation for model evaluation

### Results
The final model achieved an accuracy of 99% and a precision of 98%, effectively reducing the number of false positives while maintaining high accuracy in detecting fraudulent transactions.
